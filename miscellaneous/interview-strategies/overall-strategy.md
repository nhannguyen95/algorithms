## Beginning of the interview

Activities: introduce yourself, talk about what's on your resume, your previous work experience.

When answering quesions in this period (for example resume questions), try to be concise and tell them just enough information to understand. Don't be verbose and waste time on this.


## During the interview

Activities: coding section.

Steps to solve a problem:

- Reiterate the question and ask clarifying questions.

- Trying to come up with a solution.

- Actually coding (implement).

- Testing (running corner cases).


Treat your interviewer as a normal person, and you are collaborate with him and show off your skills.

The DONTs:

- Don't expect the problem to have a clear statement, ask your interviewer to clarify the problem.

- Don't ignore interviewer's hints and suggestions, give them a strong consideration.

- Don't be afraid to scrap your previously wrong solution and start a new one (but you should try not to introduce a wrong solution and stick with it for a long time at the first place)

- Don't spent too much time explaining brute force algorithms. Say it more quickly (in 10 secs, and say you're trying to think of something more efficient).

- You don't need to talk at all times, just say "let me think for a second", but don't take too long.


The DOs:

- Communicate your though process clearly (SAY OUT LOUD what you are about to do), solve/code the problem fast (then do it).

- Clarify assumptions faster. Focus on key assumptions like input space, input size, and functional requirements, rather than implementation issues like null values/empty array.

- Use standard algorithms and data structures as building blocks when solving an interview problem.

- To develop the general solution, you should start with small/edge case first, don't dive right into code.

- If your solution has computing things you don't need, you can assume you have already had it and maybe implement it later.


Never forget that the interviewer will have to write a feedback about your interview process, show them so that they can write positive things:

- Did the candidate explore (optimal) the solution?
- Did he cover all corner cases?
- Did he choose appropriate data structures?
- Did he correctly answer question about his solution's space and running time complexity?
- Did he explain his thought process well?
- Was his code easy to read?
- Did he walk through/test his code to verify the code was correct? Was he able to address shortcoming?

When writing a recursive problem, notice that this solution is bound by the stack space, while an iterative solution is bound by the actual memory of your machine (RAM). So an iterative solution can be preferable.

Your solution is important, so is the way  you explain it.


---

Some clarification questions you should ask:
- How big is the input?
- Clarify (what is) the input/output of the function you are about to write.
- String:
    - Upcase, lowercase, alphabet, number, ASCII..
    - Null?
- Array of numbers:
    - Empty?
    - integer, float?
- Linked-list:
    - Empty?
    - Circular
    - Singly, doubly

## Wrap-up

Activities: behavioral questions.
