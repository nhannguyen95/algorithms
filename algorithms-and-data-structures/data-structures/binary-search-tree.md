## Theory
A balanced Binary Search Tree can be used as a powerful dynamic Min-Max Priority Queue:
- We can enqueue a key into the BST in O(logN) time.
- We can identify the item with smallest key (priority) by finding the leftmost item in the BST.
- We can identify the item with largest key (priority) by finding the rightmost item in the BST.
