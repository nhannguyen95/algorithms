## Theory

### Problem

**Minimax problem**: Given an weighted undirected Graph G; for a pair of vertices (u, v), the cost of a path from u to v is the maximum edge weight along that path. Among all possible paths from u to v, pick the one with the minimum max-edge-weight.

### Solution

The max edge weight along the unique path between u and v in the MST.
