## Problems
- [Count number of smaller elements after self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/discuss/445769/merge-sort-CLEAR-simple-EXPLANATION-with-EXAMPLES-O(n-lg-n)): O(NlogN) time, O(N) space.

## Theory

**Some terminologies**

STABLE: keep the relative position of elements with equal keys after sorting.

IN-PLACE: only a constant number of elements of the input array are ever stored outside the array.

COMPARISON SORT: the sorted order determined by comparisons between the input elements
