/* Insertion sort (tested)

Time complexity:
  - T(N): the running time of the algorithm on an input of n values
    T(N) = aN^2 + b
    => order of growth = N^2
    => running time of Θ(N^2)
    and: aN^2 + b ∈ Θ(N^2)
  - Best case: the array is already sorted, Θ(N)
  - Average: Θ(N^2)
  - Worst case: the array sorted in reverse order, Θ(N^2)

  - Another nice way to think about the time complexity:
    If on average, each element is k positions from its
    correct place in sorted array, then the time
    complexity is O(nk)

Space complexity: O(1)

Stable: keep the relative position of elements with equal keys.

In-place

Insertion sort is one of the fastest for sorting small arrays (N = 7..50), why?
  - Compare to Merge sort, Quick sort: they have some extra overheads,
    (while insertion sort is very simple):
    - Recursive calls
    - Partition: need to split N to two (N/2), and so on...
    - There are some swaps need to be taken care in each partition..
  - Compare to Selection sort, Bubble sort: probably faster because fewer scans,
    iterations..

i < j, A[i] > A[j] => (i, j) is an inversion of A.
Number of swaps in IS (when sort A) = number of inversion of A.
Prove: Hint: call I(i) = number of j | j < i and A[j] > A[j]
