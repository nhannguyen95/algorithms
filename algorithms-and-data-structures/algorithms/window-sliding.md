## Problems
- Find the smallest sub-array size so that its sum is greater than
or equal to a certain constant.
- Find the smallest sub-array size so that the elements inside the
sub-array contains all integers in range [1..K].
- Find the maximum sum of a certain sub-array with static size K.
- Find the minimum of each possible sub-arrays with static size K.

## Theory

Idea: "slide" a sub-array ("window", which can have a dynamic or
static length) in linear fashion from left to right over the
original array of n elements in order to compute something.
